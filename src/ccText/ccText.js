We have made every effort to make this course as user-friendly as possible, as well as providing alternate delivery methods to accommodate those with various physical impairments, as required by Section 508 of the U.S. Workforce Rehabilitation Act of 1973, regulating accessibility of Electronic and Information Technology for Federal Departments and agencies. One of the features designed to assist those who have a physical impairment is the closed-caption button at the bottom of the screen.  Click this button to see a new window with the complete narration text for that page.  This option is available on each page.  Another barrier-free feature is the design of the color scheme.  We have selected colors that are easy to see for those with color blindness constraints.  This course has also been designed to accommodate the Accessibility Options available through Windows.  If you find that you need additional help accessing this material, please contact the webmaster at the link on this page, or call 1-877-251-0730.",
